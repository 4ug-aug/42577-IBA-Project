> [!TIP]
> It is recommended to create a python virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` and install the requirements.txt with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> [!WARNING]
> In the explorative analysis a pickle file is created for the dictionary of distances and should only be run once, or not at all if the pickle file is acquired already.

Run the `project_second_draft.ipynb` from top to bottom.
